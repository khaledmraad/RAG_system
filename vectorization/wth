80% of data in the world is unstructured so you cant put them in relationnnal databases.
like images , video and files

a vector data base indexed and store vector embedddings for fast retrieval and similarity search


unstructured data -> llm model -> vetcor embedding

vecttor also have to be indexed 

index is a data structure that facilitate the search process
so the indexing process maps vector to new data structure that can be used for faster search (a hole research field)
