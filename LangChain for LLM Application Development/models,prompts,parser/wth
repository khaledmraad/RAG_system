you can look directly to file and save effort


when you use an application using llm there is reusable models 
parse the prompt and ouput 
langchain give a lot of abstraction to do this (and many version error ofc)

talk to llm with language other then english (or just learn english) or if u work in customer service for azure you can use langchain

its lie just use fstring

if you wan the result of the llm to be in specific format you can use langchain
with langchain you can parse the output and instruct it to use certain format
